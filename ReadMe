After studying the Create Rest APIs with Spring and Java from Codecademy, I used the video
to write word for word the code.  The challenge for me was setting up the right version of
IntelliJ Idea so that I can easily have access to Spring Initializer.  After that I 
played the video multiple times to see how each part was connected.
